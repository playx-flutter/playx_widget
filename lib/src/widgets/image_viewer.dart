  /// To have finer-grained control over the way that an image's loading

  ///
  /// ## Chaining with [loadingBuilder]
  ///
  /// If a [loadingBuilder] has _also_ been specified for an image, the two

  /// be passed as the `child` argument to the [loadingBuilder]. For example,
  /// consider the following builders used in conjunction:

  /// {@template flutter.widgets.Image.frameBuilder.chainedBuildersExample}
  /// ```dart
  /// Image(
  ///   image: _image,
  ///   frameBuilder: (BuildContext context, Widget child, int? frame, bool? wasSynchronouslyLoaded) {
  ///     return Padding(
  ///       padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
  ///       child: child,
  ///     );
  ///   },
  ///   loadingBuilder: (BuildContext context, Widget child, ImageChunkEvent? loadingProgress) {
  ///     return Center(child: child);
  ///   },
  /// )
  /// ```

  ///
  /// ## Performance implications
  ///
  /// If a [loadingBuilder] is specified for an image, the [Image] widget is
  /// likely to be rebuilt on every
  /// [rendering pipeline frame](rendering/RendererBinding/drawFrame.html) until
  /// the image has loaded. This is useful for cases such as displaying a loading
  /// progress indicator, but for simpler cases such as displaying a placeholder

  /// ### Why is the default value of [gaplessPlayback] false?
  ///
  /// Having the default value of [gaplessPlayback] be false helps prevent
  /// situations where stale or misleading information might be presented.
  /// Consider the following case:
  ///
  /// We have constructed a 'Person' widget that displays an avatar [Image] of
  /// the currently loaded person along with their name. We could request for a
  /// new person to be loaded into the widget at any time. Suppose we have a
  /// person currently loaded and the widget loads a new person. What happens
  /// if the [Image] fails to load?
  ///
  /// * Option A ([gaplessPlayback] = false): The new person's name is coupled
  /// with a blank image.
  ///
  /// * Option B ([gaplessPlayback] = true): The widget displays the avatar of
  /// the previous person and the name of the newly loaded person.
  ///
  /// This is why the default value is false. Most of the time, when you change
  /// the image provider you're not just changing the image, you're removing the
  /// old widget and adding a new one and not expecting them to have any
  /// relationship. With [gaplessPlayback] on you might accidentally break this
  /// expectation and re-use the old widget.

  ///
  /// To create the widget with an asset from a package, the [package] argument
  /// must be provided. For instance, suppose a package called `my_icons` has
  /// `icons/heart.png` .
  ///
  /// {@tool snippet}

  ///
  /// If the desired asset is specified in the `pubspec.yaml` of the package, it
  /// is bundled automatically with the app. In particular, assets used by the
  /// package itself must be specified in its `pubspec.yaml`.
  ///
  /// A package can also choose to have assets in its 'lib/' folder that are not
  /// specified in its `pubspec.yaml`. In this case for those images to be
  /// bundled, the app has to specify which ones to include. For instance a
